# However, it is ONLY the `.a` file which MUST start with "lib", it is fine to let the `.xcframework` be named
# "RadixEngineToolkit", it is also fine to let the module in `module.modulemap` to be `RadixEngineToolkit` and 
# thus the Swift `binaryTarget`. And also, header file does not need to be named "libradix_engine_toolkit.h", 
# the header can probably be named whatever actually, as long as it matches what is specified in the 
# `module.modulemap`. So the (Swift)EngineToolkit target will never ever see that the `.a` file is
# prefix with the name "lib". So all is well!
